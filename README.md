# Edge Detection and Image Enhancement

This project focuses on edge detection and image enhancement techniques using Python and OpenCV. It provides functions for applying edge detection algorithms such as Roberts, Prewitt, and Sobel to grayscale images, as well as performing median blur to reduce noise.

## Features

- Edge detection using Roberts, Prewitt, and Sobel operators.
- Median blur for noise reduction.
- Grayscale image processing.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python and OpenCV installed.
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Run the Python script to apply the selected edge detection and noise reduction methods.
4. View the processed images in the OpenCV window.
